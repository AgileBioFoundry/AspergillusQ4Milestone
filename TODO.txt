notes:
- measurements at t=0,92,160 hours
- calculate biomass at t=92 hours from innoculation at t=0 and biomass at t=160, assuming exponential growth for first 24 hours then linear afterwards.
    if we have doubling time then we can estimate biomass at t=24 hours. 
- ICE ID --> strain metadata from ICE.agilebiofoundry.org
- glucose, 3HP, ethanol, erythritol, citric acid


Questions:
- glucose = starting_amount*dilution_factor?
- is glucose(t=160 hours) = glucose(t=0)*dilution_factor or glucose(t=92)*dilution_factor?
- is oxygen consumption measured?
- "(βAl-3HP)+, pyc2++, Δald6a" what does "++" mean? Is that multiple genomic integration or plasmid?
- what is the difference between "aat2(mt)+" vs "aat2(cy)+"? (probably compartment where gene is expressed)
- what is the difference between "Δald6a+NeoR" vs "Δald6a"
- what is the difference between "ΔoahA-C5" vs "ΔoahA-C7"?
- what is "Dald6b"? a deletion? 
- what is the difference between "ΔcoaT-4" and "ΔcoaT-10"?
- what is the HPLD_ID?
- glucose consumed = glucose(t=0) - glucose(t=92)? 
- are 3HP Titer (g/L), DCW (g/L), Yield (g 3HP/g glucose), and Rate (g 3HP/Lh) all at t=160?
- what preprocessing/normalization was done on global and targeted proteomics?
- can we get INCHI, BIOCYC, and BIGG IDs for the internal metabolites?

Todo:
- calculate glucose flux from 3 glucose measurements
- calculate external fluxes from 3 extracellular metabolite concentration measurements 
- add media composition to PGDB and FBA model
- calculate the biomass growth rate 
- compute internal fluxes using eflux2 (global or targeted proteomics and computed extracellular flux) [depends on extracellular flux calculations]
- estimate lower and upper bounds on CO2 flux using FBA 
- add non native protein IDs to aspni7 cyc (target has hpdh vs global has HPDH_escherichia_coli)
- internal metabolite identification/mapping
