# FY21Q4 milestone for Agile BioFoundry

Demonstrate a cross-validated 20% improvement in predictive power (e.g., improved accuracy/precision/correlation between predicted and observed) for two or more ABF Learn methodologies as a function of data volume, velocity, and/or veracity, for multiple vs. single data modalities.

## Abstract

To improve titers, rates and yields for 3-hydroxypropionate production in ABF host organism Aspergillus niger, we employed Bayesian metabolic control analysis (BMCA) to multiomics data generated for 17 engineered strains.  Top overexpression candidates included glucose importers, phosphofructokinase (r10), pyruvate carboxylase (r19),  and mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (r258m), and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (r12a). Top repression candidates included ALD6, which converts 3-oxoproprionate to Acetyl-CoA, HNO3 export, D-gluconate export, transport of acetaldehyde from the cytosol to the mitochondria (r1148) and malate dehydrogenase (r44).  These results were compared against single modal correlation analyses between enzymes and 3HP flux.
